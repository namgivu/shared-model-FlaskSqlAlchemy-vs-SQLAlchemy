In brief, the topic is about "shared model object in Flask-SqlAlchemy http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/ vs pure SQLAlchemy http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"

In full, we have 02 different Python-based apps i.e. 1) Flask web app aka. `flask app`, and 2) native Python console app aka. `python app`.

We use Flask-SQLAlchemy for flask app and SqlAlchemy for python app.
 
The two apps share the same mysql database schema that get changed during project development period - this requires the Python `model` classes to be shared too so as to have minimal model's code to be synced.

Side Notes
---
- Use mysql TEXT against VARCHAR

  > Unless you need to index these columns (in which case VARCHAR is much faster) there is no reason to use VARCHAR over TEXT
